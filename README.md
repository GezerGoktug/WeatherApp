# Weather App ‚õÖ

**<p>In this project, a weather application was created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. By entering the names of the cities and pressing the enter button, you can access the current weather condition, humidity, pressure, wind speed and real, min, max temperature values ‚Äã‚Äãof that city. OpenWeather Api was used for weather data in the project. Data was retrieved with the fetch API, which is a JavaScript tool for sending HTTP requests to a URL locally. Additionally, the temperature unit can be converted to Fahrenheit or Celsius in the project.</p>**
